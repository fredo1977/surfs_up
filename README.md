## Compare Findings to July and December
--July has higher tempareature averages(min and max) compared to December, although not by much. Results of difference was roughly 4 to 5 degrees. Weather is believed to be a variable in sales. Taking a look at precipitation, mid-year (June) has an avearge of 1.3 inches of rain and at the end of year that is assumed to be worst weather, has an average of 2.2 inches of rain. 

## Recommendations 
# Compare tourism: if weather of temperature and tourism are sustainable, then we could analyze forcasted sales; noting that rain is an outlier
# Complete same analysis for all islands 
# Quarterly graphing data to visualize weather projections/month
